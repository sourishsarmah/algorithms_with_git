# Binomial Coefficient
A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of X^k in the expansion of (1 + X)^n
A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order,
that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set.

### Input Format
First line contains n and k.Where n is the number of objects
and k is the number of objects selected.

### Output Format
Number of ways of selecting k objects from the set of n objects.

### Sample Input
```
10 3
```

### Sample Output
```
120
```
### Implemented in:
- [Python](binomialCoefficient.py)
